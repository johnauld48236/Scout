## VALUE PROPOSITION

### Value Proposition Statement

We eliminate the trade-off between innovation speed and compliance safety for regulated product manufacturers.

While static compliance tools force manual rework every time a vulnerability emerges or requirement changes, our dynamic compliance orchestration platform automatically responds - regenerating threat models, updating documentation, and maintaining version control.

**Result:** 75% faster TARA processes, living compliance packages that evolve with your product, and the freedom to innovate at market speed without compliance risk.

### Key Differentiators

**1. Dynamic vs. Static**
Competitors deliver point-in-time compliance artifacts that require manual rework when threats/requirements change. We deliver living systems that respond automatically. When a CVE drops, static tools require manual regeneration of entire submission packages. Our platform auto-triages, triggers workflows, regenerates documents, and maintains version control.

**2. Lifecycle Orchestration**
Not just tools (SBOM, TARA) but full workflow automation from requirement decomposition to document generation to PLM/ERP/QMS integration. We embed into the product lifecycle, not bolt-on as a standalone tool.

**3. Context-Driven Risk**
We don't just report CVEs - we assess exploitability against your actual product architecture via attack trees, reducing false positives and prioritizing real risk. This creates efficiency for cyber teams and software teams to not change components for no reason.

**4. Regulatory Expertise Built-In**
Deep domain knowledge in FDA 524B (medical) and UN R155/ISO 21434 (automotive) - not generic security tooling adapted to compliance. Work product generation for ISO 21434 reports that competitors don't provide.

**5. Speed**
75% faster TARA (automotive verified), automated work product generation, AI-accelerated threat scenario synthesis via AutoSynth.

## TARGET MARKET

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Regulated product manufacturers facing imminent compliance deadlines who are experiencing the trade-off problem: forced to choose between shipping at market speed OR completing compliance rigor.

**Characteristics:**
- Complex products with continuous updates (software-defined vehicles, connected medical devices)
- Heterogeneous supply chains generating compliance overhead
- Currently managing compliance manually or with disconnected point tools
- Budget authority sits with CISO, VP Engineering, or CTO - not IT procurement
- 5+ concurrent development programs
- 50+ software components per product
- Active regulatory submissions or certifications in progress

### Target Verticals

**Primary:**
- Medical Device Manufacturing (FDA 524B cyber devices)
- Automotive OEMs & Tier 1/2/3 Suppliers (UN R155, ISO/SAE 21434)

**Emerging:**
- Industrial IoT / Connected Products (CRA - Cyber Resilience Act)
- Agricultural Equipment OEMs (CNH, John Deere archetypes)

**Future Expansion Candidates:**
- Aerospace/Defense (DO-178C, ARP4754A)
- Energy/Infrastructure (NERC CIP, critical infrastructure)

### Target Company Sizes

**Sweet Spot:** Mid-market to Enterprise ($500M - $50B+ revenue)

- Large enough to have dedicated product security functions and regulatory compliance teams
- Small enough that security burden is overwhelming without platform support

### Target Geographies

**Primary:** North America (US), Europe (DACH, UK, Nordics)

**Emerging:** Israel, Japan, Korea (automotive OEMs)

**Note:** US companies selling into EU need CRA compliance regardless of headquarters location.

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Key Competitors

**SBOM/Vulnerability Point Solutions:**
- Black Duck (Synopsys) - binary scanning, snippet scanning
- Manifest Cyber
- Mend
- Finite State

**Threat Modeling Tools:**
- IriusRisk
- Foreseeti
- ANSYS Medini

**Medical-Specific:**
- MedCrypt
- Orthogonal

**Enterprise GRC (moving into product security):**
- ServiceNow
- Archer

**Former Competitor:**
- Cybellum (acquired by LG)

**The Real Competitor:**
- Excel + manual processes (status quo)
- Build vs. buy (internal tool development)

### Competitive Positioning

**vs. Point Solutions (Black Duck, Manifest, etc.):**
"They deliver tools; we deliver outcomes. They provide data; you still have to figure out what to do with it. We orchestrate the entire compliance workflow - from threat identification to document generation to audit readiness. Black Duck doesn't generate ISO 21434 work products. We do."

**vs. Static Platforms:**
"They link artifacts at a point in time. We process dynamically. When a CVE drops, their snapshot is stale - yours regenerates automatically."

**vs. Manual/Excel:**
"You're forcing trade-offs: speed OR safety. We eliminate trade-offs: ship at market speed AND maintain compliance rigor. Excel doesn't scale - quality and repeatability suffer."

**vs. Do-It-Yourself:**
"They mandate trade-offs (speed OR safety); we provide both (speed AND safety)."

### Key Win Themes

- Work product generation (ISO 21434 reports - competitors don't do this)
- Context-based risk (attack tree exploitability vs. raw CVE scores)
- Lifecycle integration (embedded into PLM/QMS, not a bolt-on tool)
- Regulatory domain expertise (FDA 524B, UN R155 native)
- Automation advantage (full workflow, not just scanning)
- BI and reports capability that point solutions lack

### What We Avoid

- Direct feature-by-feature comparisons with point solution vendors
- "Better SBOM" or "Better TARA" positioning (commodity trap)
- Claims of technological superiority devoid of business outcome connection

### Our Category Claim

"Static compliance artifacts compel trade-offs. Dynamic compliance systems eliminate trade-offs."

## BUYING SIGNALS

### Buying Triggers

**Regulatory Forcing Functions:**
- FDA 524B submission deadline approaching (medical)
- UN R155 type approval timeline (automotive)
- CRA compliance requirement for EU market access (all connected products)

**Pain Events:**
- Failed audit or regulatory rejection
- CVE disclosure requiring emergency rework
- Departing key compliance person (single point of failure)
- Acquisition requiring compliance harmonization

**Strategic Initiatives:**
- New product line with connected/cyber components
- Digital transformation of product development
- Supply chain visibility initiative
- Shift-left security mandate

**Competitive Displacement:**
- Frustration with Black Duck complexity/cost
- Excel/manual process hitting scale limits
- Consultant recommendation during compliance assessment (LHP, similar)

### Qualification Criteria (BANT Framework)

**Budget - Must Have:**
- Dedicated product security budget OR active regulatory compliance spend
- Not IT security budget only

**Authority - Must Have:**
- Access to CISO, VP Engineering, VP Regulatory, or CTO
- NOT IT procurement-led
- Note: In automotive, budget often sits with CTO not CISO

**Need - Must Have:**
- Active compliance requirement (FDA 524B, UN R155, CRA)
- OR imminent regulatory audit
- OR renewal cycle of incumbent tool creating evaluation window

**Timeline - Must Have:**
- Regulatory deadline within 12 months
- OR renewal cycle of incumbent tool

## SALES CONTEXT

### Typical Sales Cycle

**Duration:** 6-12 months for new logo enterprise deals

**Phases:**
1. Discovery + Technical Validation (POC)
2. Commercial Negotiation
3. Legal/Procurement
4. Close

**Land & Expand Pattern:**
- Initial module sale (often TARA) at $200K-$500K
- 90-day value proof period
- Expansion to additional modules and users
- Strategic accounts evolve over 2-3 years from $400K to $2M+ ARR

### Average Deal Size

**Initial Land:**
- $200K-$500K ARR (single module, limited users)

**Expansion Target:**
- $1M-$2M+ ARR (platform-wide, enterprise license)

**Range by Segment:**
- Mid-market Medical Device: $150K-$400K
- Automotive Tier 1: $300K-$600K
- Automotive OEM: $500K-$2M+
- Enterprise Platform Deals: $1M-$3M+

### Key Stakeholder Roles

**Economic Buyer:**
- CTO or CISO (budget authority)
- Note: In automotive, often CTO not CISO

**Technical Champion:**
- VP Product Security
- Director of Cybersecurity Engineering
- Principal Security Architect

**Influencer:**
- VP Regulatory Affairs
- VP Quality/Compliance
- VP Engineering

**Gatekeeper:**
- IT Security (can block but rarely drives)
- Procurement (late-stage)

**User Stakeholders:**
- Product Security Engineers
- Compliance Analysts
- Software Development Teams (for CI/CD integration)

**Critical Pattern:**
Multi-threaded engagement required. Single-thread relationships are vulnerable to champion departure (e.g., Vivek departure from CNH to Ford).
