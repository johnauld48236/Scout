# C2A Security - Medical Device Campaign Configuration
## Sales Intelligence AI Campaign Context

*Campaign Type: Vertical (Evergreen)*
*Status: Active*
*Last Updated: January 2026*

---

## CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

### Campaign Name
Medical Device

### Campaign Type
Vertical (Evergreen) - ongoing market development, not time-bound

### Strategic Context
Medical device manufacturers face a regulatory inflection point. FDA Section 524B (effective March 2023) now mandates cybersecurity documentation, SBOM submission, and postmarket vulnerability management for all "cyber devices." Most manufacturers are unprepared - scrambling with manual processes that delay submissions and create audit risk. C2A's EVSec platform transforms this compliance burden into competitive advantage.

### Campaign Objectives
1. Build pipeline of qualified medical device opportunities from H-ISAC network and direct outreach
2. Position C2A as the bridge bringing automotive cybersecurity maturity to medical device sector
3. Convert webinar/event leads into demos and POCs
4. Establish reference customers for medical device vertical

## CAMPAIGN VALUE PROPOSITION

### Primary Message (Override Base)

Medical device manufacturers face a new reality: FDA Section 524B now requires cybersecurity documentation, SBOM submission, and postmarket vulnerability management for every cyber device. Most teams are scrambling with manual processes that delay submissions and create audit risk.

**EVSec transforms FDA cybersecurity compliance from a bottleneck into an enabler.**

When a CVE is disclosed, your 524B package updates automatically - threat models regenerate, documents version, evidence consolidates. Ship device updates at market speed without compliance risk. Living compliance packages, not frozen snapshots.

### Value Proposition Variations

**For VP Regulatory Affairs:**
"Your 524B submission package is a living system, not a frozen snapshot. When new vulnerabilities emerge, EVSec automatically updates threat assessments, regenerates documentation, and maintains the audit trail FDA expects. No more scrambling before submission deadlines."

**For VP Product Security / CISO:**
"Stop choosing between shipping on time and completing security documentation. EVSec automates the TARA process, generates compliant work products, and maintains continuous visibility into your device security posture across the entire portfolio."

**For VP Engineering / R&D:**
"Security documentation shouldn't slow down your release cycles. EVSec integrates into your development workflow, automatically tracking software components, assessing vulnerabilities in context, and generating the artifacts regulatory needs without manual handoffs."

**For VP Quality/Compliance:**
"One platform, one source of truth for auditors. EVSec consolidates evidence across device programs, maintains complete traceability from requirements to mitigations, and generates audit-ready reports on demand."

### Differentiation in Medical Device Context

**vs. Generic Security Tools (Qualys, Tenable, etc.):**
"They scan IT infrastructure. We secure medical devices. EVSec understands FDA 524B requirements, generates compliant documentation, and integrates with your QMS - not your SOC."

**vs. SBOM-Only Tools (Finite State, Cybeats, etc.):**
"SBOM is one requirement. 524B demands postmarket plans, vulnerability management processes, and ongoing assurance. EVSec orchestrates the entire compliance lifecycle, not just component inventory."

**vs. Manual/Excel Processes:**
"Every CVE disclosure means manual rework. Every submission deadline means documentation scramble. EVSec automates what can be automated so your team focuses on security decisions, not paperwork."

**vs. Competitors (MedCrypt, etc.):**
"We bring automotive-grade cybersecurity maturity to medical devices. The same platform trusted by global OEMs for UN R155 compliance now addresses FDA 524B - with proven methodology and 75% faster threat analysis."

**Subject:** 524B documentation automation for [Company]

**Body:**
[First Name], I noticed [Company] has [specific trigger: recent 510(k) filing / connected device launch / etc.].

With FDA 524B now requiring SBOM submission and postmarket vulnerability management, most device manufacturers are finding cybersecurity documentation is the new bottleneck for submissions.

We help medical device companies automate 524B compliance - living documentation that updates automatically when CVEs emerge, instead of manual rework before every submission.

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see if this applies to your current pipeline?

### Cold Outreach - Product Security

**Subject:** From automotive to medical device security

**Body:**
[First Name], C2A Security built the platform that major automotive OEMs use for UN R155 cybersecurity compliance. We're now bringing that same rigor to medical devices facing FDA 524B.

The parallel is striking: regulated products, continuous software updates, supply chain complexity, and compliance documentation that never ends.

Our platform automates TARA, generates compliant SBOMs, and maintains audit-ready evidence - the same approach that achieves 75% faster threat analysis in automotive.

Interested in seeing how this translates to your device portfolio?

### Event Follow-Up (H-ISAC)

**Subject:** Following up from H-ISAC - [specific topic discussed]

**Body:**
[First Name], great connecting at the H-ISAC [event name]. Your point about [specific challenge mentioned] resonated - we hear that from most device manufacturers we talk to.
