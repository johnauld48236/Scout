# C2A Security - CRA Campaign Configuration
## Sales Intelligence AI Campaign Context

*Campaign Type: Thematic (Time-Bound)*
*Status: Planned - H1 2026 Launch*
*Last Updated: January 2026*

---

## CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

### Campaign Name
CRA (Cyber Resilience Act)

### Campaign Type
Thematic (Time-Bound) - regulatory deadline driving urgency

### Strategic Context
The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) represents the most significant cybersecurity regulation for connected products since GDPR transformed data privacy. Effective 2027 with compliance requirements phasing in from late 2025, CRA mandates cybersecurity requirements for virtually all products with digital elements sold in the EU market - regardless of where they're manufactured.

**The global impact:** US, Asian, and other non-EU manufacturers selling into EU must comply. This creates a massive market opportunity for compliance platforms, and C2A's automotive cybersecurity expertise (UN R155, ISO 21434) directly translates to CRA requirements.

### Campaign Objectives
1. Establish C2A as the go-to platform for CRA compliance before market education peaks
2. Capture early-mover manufacturers seeking competitive advantage
3. Position automotive expertise as proof of methodology for broader product categories
4. Build pipeline ahead of compliance deadline pressure (2026-2027)

### Timeline Context
- **December 2024:** CRA entered into force
- **September 2026:** Reporting obligations begin (vulnerability disclosure)
- **December 2027:** Full compliance required for new products
- **Campaign Window:** H1 2026 launch to capture planning/budgeting cycles

## CAMPAIGN VALUE PROPOSITION

### Primary Message

The EU Cyber Resilience Act changes everything for connected products. By December 2027, every product with digital elements sold in the EU must demonstrate cybersecurity by design, maintain vulnerability management processes, and provide security support throughout the product lifecycle.

**The scope is unprecedented:** Software products, IoT devices, industrial equipment, consumer electronics - if it has code and connects, CRA applies.

**EVSec delivers CRA compliance velocity.**

The same platform that achieves 75% faster threat analysis for automotive (UN R155) and automates FDA 524B for medical devices now addresses CRA's comprehensive requirements. One platform for security risk assessment, SBOM management, vulnerability handling, and conformity documentation across your entire product portfolio.

### Value Proposition Variations

**For VP Product Security / CISO:**
"CRA requires demonstrable cybersecurity throughout the product lifecycle - from design through end-of-support. EVSec provides the systematic approach: threat modeling tied to your architecture, vulnerability management with context-based triage, and audit-ready evidence of security controls. The methodology proven in automotive now applies to every connected product."

**For VP Regulatory Affairs / Compliance:**
"CRA conformity assessment requires documentation you probably don't have today: security risk assessments, vulnerability handling procedures, SBOM for every product, incident response processes. EVSec generates compliant work products automatically, maintains evidence trails, and keeps documentation current as products and threats evolve."

**For VP Engineering / R&D:**
"Security by design isn't optional under CRA - it's a market access requirement. EVSec integrates into your development workflow, making security documentation a byproduct of good engineering rather than a bureaucratic afterthought. Continuous compliance without continuous overhead."

**For CEO / GM (Market Access Angle):**
"No CE marking without CRA compliance. No EU market access without CE marking. EVSec ensures your products meet CRA requirements efficiently - the same platform already trusted by automotive OEMs for their EU type approvals. Protect your EU revenue while competitors scramble."

**For Supply Chain / Procurement:**
"CRA makes you responsible for components in your products. EVSec provides supply chain visibility - SBOM management, component vulnerability tracking, and supplier security assessment. Know what's in your products and prove it to regulators."

### Differentiation in CRA Context

**vs. Generic GRC Tools:**
"CRA requires product-specific security evidence, not IT policy documentation. EVSec understands product architectures, generates technical threat models, and tracks vulnerabilities in context - not checkbox compliance."

**vs. Consultants/Manual Approaches:**
"Consultants help you understand CRA. EVSec helps you comply with CRA - continuously, across your product portfolio, with documentation that stays current. Scale compliance without scaling headcount."

**vs. Point Solutions:**
"SBOM tools give you component inventory. Vulnerability scanners give you CVE lists. CRA requires the complete picture: how vulnerabilities affect your specific products, what mitigations you've applied, evidence of secure development. EVSec orchestrates the entire compliance lifecycle."

**Our Credibility:**
"We've done this before. UN R155 (automotive cybersecurity type approval) has similar requirements to CRA - and stricter enforcement. The methodology that achieves 75% faster compliance in automotive directly applies to CRA. We're not learning product security compliance with you; we're extending proven approaches to a new regulation."

## MESSAGING TEMPLATES

### Cold Outreach - General

**Subject:** CRA compliance for [Company] products

**Body:**
[First Name], the EU Cyber Resilience Act takes effect December 2027 - which means products shipping in late 2026 need to be designed for compliance now.

For [Company] with significant EU market presence, CRA impacts [specific product category inferred from research]. The requirements parallel automotive cybersecurity (UN R155) - and that's exactly where we've built our expertise.

C2A's EVSec platform achieves 75% faster threat analysis for automotive OEMs. We're now helping connected product manufacturers apply the same methodology to CRA compliance - systematic security risk assessment, automated documentation, and SBOM management across the product portfolio.

Worth a conversation about how [Company] is approaching CRA?

### Cold Outreach - US Company

**Subject:** Selling into EU? CRA compliance deadline approaching

**Body:**
[First Name], US companies selling connected products into the EU face a new reality: the Cyber Resilience Act requires cybersecurity compliance for market access, regardless of where products are manufactured.

By December 2027, [Company]'s [product category] will need demonstrable security-by-design, vulnerability management processes, and SBOM documentation to maintain CE marking.

We help manufacturers build CRA compliance into development processes - not as a last-minute checkbox but as a systematic approach that scales across your product portfolio. The methodology is proven: automotive OEMs use our platform for UN R155 compliance, which has similar requirements and stricter enforcement.

Interested in discussing how [Company] is preparing?

### Event/Webinar Follow-Up

**Subject:** CRA compliance - next steps after [event]

**Body:**
[First Name], thanks for attending [event/webinar]. Your question about [specific topic if available, or "managing CRA across a diverse product portfolio"] is something we hear frequently.

C2A's approach focuses on operational compliance, not just awareness. Our EVSec platform automates the security risk assessment, SBOM generation, and documentation that CRA requires - making compliance a continuous process rather than a deadline scramble.

Given [Company]'s product portfolio, there's likely significant CRA exposure. Would it be helpful to walk through how other manufacturers are approaching this systematically?

### Automotive Customer Expansion

**Subject:** CRA compliance - extending your UN R155 investment

**Body:**
[First Name], you already know EVSec from your UN R155 compliance work. The good news: CRA requirements are conceptually similar. The methodology that works for automotive cybersecurity directly applies.

The even better news: EVSec can extend that proven approach to your non-automotive connected products. Same platform, same methodology, new regulation covered.

For [Company]'s [industrial/consumer/other division], CRA compliance becomes an incremental effort rather than starting from scratch. Worth discussing how to leverage what you've already built?
